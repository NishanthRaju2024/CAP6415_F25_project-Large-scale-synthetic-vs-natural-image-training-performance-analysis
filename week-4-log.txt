Week 4 (ending on November 30)
------------------------------------
- Preliminary Results: The "Mixed Data" experiment (50% Real / 50% Synthetic) failed, flatlining at ~88% accuracy.
- Hypothesis: The model is confused by the simultaneous distribution shift (Shape vs. Texture).
- Strategy Update: Pivoted to "Curriculum Learning" (Sim-to-Real).
- Implementation: Coded a two-stage training engine:
  - Stage 1: Train on Synthetic (High Learning Rate).
  - Stage 2: Fine-tune on Real (Low Learning Rate).
- final validation runs.
