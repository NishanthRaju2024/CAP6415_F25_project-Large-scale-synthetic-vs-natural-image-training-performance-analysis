Week 3 (ending on November 23)
------------------------------------
- Experiment (Baselines): Implemented the training loop for ResNet50 and ViT-B/16.
- Run 1 (Real Data Only): Achieved 90.3% accuracy. Observed heavy overfitting (Train 98% vs Test 90%).
- Run 2 (Synthetic Data Only): Achieved 91.3% accuracy.
- Analysis: The synthetic simulation successfully acted as a regularizer, forcing the model to learn robust shapes rather than texture noise.
- Investigating if mixing data improves performance further.
